I am a final year computer science Ph.D. student in the research group "Practical Formal Methods" at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) (MPI-SWS). My advisor is [Dr. Maria Christakis](https://mariachris.github.io/). I recieved my master's degree from the University of Freiburg, Germany, in 2018. My research interests lie primarily in the fields of automatic testing, debugging, formal analysis and verification of complex software systems.
